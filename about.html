        <p class="lead">Hey there! This is Jeffrey speaking. I'm the mastermind behind the Enoshima-kun's Commission Site. In case you're wondering about the artist, you've come to the right place.
		Allow me to introduce you to Enoshima-kun, a talented artist who drew all of these <a href="gallery.html">artworks</a>.</p>

		<p class="lead">Now, about Enoshima-kun: he's an amazing artist who draws for fun, and occasionally makes profit out of it (It is in essence, a small business establishment). His skills in both traditional and digital arts are exceptionally godtier!
		He may as well be the next Van Gogh in this generation. However... he has severe social anxiety and because of it, he only has a few clients—myself included.</p> 
		
		<p class="lead">As his no.1 fan, I can proudly say it’s an honor to create this website to support him. My job is to make sure you can get in touch with him, commission his art, and make this whole process as smooth as possible.
		So, please support the artist by commissioning him through this website!</p>
		
		<p class="lead">Therefore! If you want your original character drawn or reimagined in Enoshima-kun's artstyle, or if you have a favorite character you want to draw, but lack the skills to do so, look no further!
		Commission your artwork right here on this site!
		
		<hr />
		<br />
		<p class="lead">P.S.: I just got promoted from being his no.1 fan to his personal assistant/commission manager. All communications and transactions will now be handled by me!</p>
